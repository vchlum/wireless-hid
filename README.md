## GNOME Shell extension
  - wireless-hid shows the battery of the wireless keyboards, mice, and game controllers
    - Displays battery percentage with coloured status indicators
    - Supports multiple devices
  - Supports GNOME 45+
  - Inspired by the Keyboard battery extension on e.g.o

## Troubleshooting
  - This extension simply displays information from `upower`
  - If you have a problem, please check `upower -d`
    - If the information there matches the extension, the extension is behaving correctly
    - If the information and extension don't match, report an issue [here](https://github.com/vchlum/wireless-hid/issues)
  - If your device isn't recognised by `upower`, there's nothing the extension can do

    - This setting hides these devices:
